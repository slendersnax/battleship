# Battleship in C (minor) ++

An implementation of the Battleship game using C++ and the SFML library

### build

So far it has only been tested on Arch Linux.

It's made using C++ and SFML and built using the `make` utility, so on Arch you have to install the `sfml` and `make` packages (and `gcc` if you don't have it installed already).

### todo

- [ ] clean up code
- [ ] make Linux distro agnostic build
- [ ] make Windows build
